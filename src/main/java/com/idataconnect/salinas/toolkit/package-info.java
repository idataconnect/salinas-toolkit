/**
 * Casciian - Java Text User Interface library
 *
 * <p>
 * This library is a text-based windowing system loosely reminiscent of
 * Borland's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision">Turbo
 * Vision</a> library.  Jexer's goal is to enable people to get up and
 * running with minimum hassle and lots of polish.  A very quick "Hello
 * World" application can be created as simply as this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * import com.idataconnect.salinas.toolkit.TApplication;
 *
 * public class MyApplication extends TApplication {
 *
 *     public MyApplication() throws Exception {
 *         super(BackendType.XTERM);
 *
 *         // Create standard menus for Tool, File, and Window.
 *         addToolMenu();
 *         addFileMenu();
 *         addWindowMenu();
 *     }
 *
 *     public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception {
 *         MyApplication app = new MyApplication();
 *         app.run();
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
